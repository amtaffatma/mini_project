    <p>A Doll’s House, play in three acts by Henrik Ibsen, published in Norwegian as Et dukkehjem in 1879 and performed the
    same year. The play centres on an ordinary family—Torvald Helmer, a bank lawyer, and his wife, Nora, and their three
    little children.</p>
<hr>
    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p style="color: fuchsia;">The play concerns the fate of a married woman, who, at the time in Norway, lacked reasonable opportunities for
    self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. Despite the fact that Ibsen denied it was his intent to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist">feminists</a>
    play, it was a great sensation at the time<sup>[2]</sup>and caused a "storm of outraged controversy" that went beyond the
    theater to the world of newspapers and society.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
